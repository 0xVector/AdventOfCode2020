# **Advent of Code 2020**

My solutions for Advent of Code 2020 in Python.
I try to write solutions as elegant, readable and Pythonic as I can.
Sometimes I can do it pretty nicely, sometimes I'm glad I have a solution :D
I improve the solutions I'm not completely happy with if my spare time allows it.

Solution for day _i_ looks for an input file in **inputs/day*i*.txt**
